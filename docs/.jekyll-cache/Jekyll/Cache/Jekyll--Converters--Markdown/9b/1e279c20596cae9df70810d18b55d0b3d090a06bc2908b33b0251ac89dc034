<p>The eln.epfl.ch is a <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo#:~:text=A%20fork%20is%20a%20copy,without%20affecting%20the%20original%20project">fork</a> of the ELN developed by the <a href="github.com/cheminfo">cheminfo GitHub organization</a></p>

<h1 id="what-makes-it-different-form-other-elns">What makes it different form other ELNs?</h1>

<p><em>With eln.epfl.ch <a href="https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/">FAIR data</a> is not an afterthought of a data management plan (DMP).</em></p>

<p>Upon importation to the ELN all data are converted into standardized, and open formats like <a href="http://jcamp-dx.org/">JCAMP-DX</a>. All synthesis, analysis, and notes can be exported with metadata to a Zenodo in a form that is amenable to datamining efforts</p>

<p><em>Data is â€œalive all the time</em></p>

<p>You can interact with the data in the ELN. You can peak picks, analyze it, superimpose it, zoom into it. But youâ€”or the readers of your paperâ€”can use the same functionalities after export to Zenodo.</p>

<p><em>Free and open-source</em></p>

<p>All software we develop(ed) for this ELN is free and open-source. This means that you can inspect in detail what is happening when we convert file formats or analyze your dataâ€”something that is typically not possible with proprietary software.</p>

<h1 id="is-this-production-ready">Is this production-ready?</h1>

<p>Many research groups around the world and at EPFL use it for production. In fact, many ISIC services, like the elemental analysis, are tightly integrated with the ELN.</p>

<p>For the ELN, we have developed about 180 packages which receive about 250â€™000 downloads per weekâ€”but not only for chemistry applications! <a href="https://webkit.org/blog/7536/jsc-loves-es6/">Browsers use one of our packages to perform speedtests</a> and our most popular package, <a href="https://github.com/mljs/ml">ml</a> has <a href="https://github.com/mljs/ml/stargazers">more than two thousand stars on GitHub</a>.</p>

<h1 id="how-can-i-get-started">How can I get started?</h1>

<p>If you are based at EPFL, it is easy! You just have to visit eln.epfl.ch and log in with your GASPAR account.</p>

<p>If you are not based at EPFL, you can use many of the functionalities at c6h6.org or <a href="https://github.com/cheminfo/roc-eln-docker">deploy your own ELN</a>.</p>

<h1 id="where-is-my-data-stored">Where is my data stored?</h1>

<p>The system is configured as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-master_replication">double master</a> meaning there are two master databases that are in different buildings at EPFL and are continuously synchronized.</p>

<p>Data can be nightly exported to the file system (e.g., <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sb1files.epfl.ch</code>) so that you can anytime leave with all your data. Data can be published in a couple of clicks to Zenodo (for <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/4044212">here</a> for an example) or downloaded as zip?</p>
